SewaSetu is a PWA connecting donors and NGOs to reduce wastage and provide timely help. It enables donations of food, books, clothes, medicines, and essentials with real-time alerts, location-based rescue requests, and pickup scheduling. Features for volunteer drives and impact reports are planned.
